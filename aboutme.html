     <hr>
    <p>This page lists some stuff about me. Although I love computer programming, I do have interests in other domains as well. One thing that I am very passionate in is singing. I have been singing for as long as I can remember and I enjoy it very much. I have sang for several school events, the national anthem for several award ceremonies, and even for some charity events. I was also a member of a choir for three years.

    <p><br>I am a soprano, meaning that I fall in the highest singing range. One of the best feelings is standing on a stage, with the lights shining, singing your heart out. As aformentioned, I have sung for several different events in my school and local community. In my school choir, I was often a soloist. I have sung for several school masses, being the designated cantor for each one. I found that singing in a choir was probably one of the best experiences, as I got to hear how everyone's different voices can come together and make something beautiful!</p>   <br>

    <p> <br>Although I have performed often, that does not come without practice. I find that the best way to practice singing and how to perform is to record myself and then watch them. This way, I get an idea of how I sing and my facial expressions when performing. It is easier to critique oneself by doing it this way. This is one of the recordings I have from practicing. I was not going to include a video of myself singing in this project, but Shairagavi insisted that if I am including an about page that discusses singing, I must. So, as to Shairagavi's request, here it is :) haha.</p><br>
